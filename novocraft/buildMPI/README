Customising NovoalignMPI & NovoalignCSMPI


This folder contains a set of source files and libraries so that users can 
compile and link Novocraft MPI programs against different version and settings 
of MPI.

The scripts have been tested on CentOS 5.9, MAC OSX 10.5, Ubuntu 12.10 & 11.10 
using MPICH2 and MPICH. There is no guarantee they will run on other systems 
or with other MPIs such as OpenMPI. The libraries have been compiled with GCC 4.7.2

The folder contains object libraries for Novoalign, Bamtools and, for some 
systems, Tcmalloc & Unwind.

There are also 4 source files
   mpidriver.h		This routine encapsulates all the MPI API functions used by 
                    Novoalign and the main driver for passing messages.
   mpidriver.cc
   trace.cc		    A Stack Dump routine
   TTimer.hh        A routine used in MPI wait message loop.


BUILDING

1. Ensure MPICH or MPICH2 installed and working. On some systems you may need to...
     module load mpich2
2. Ensure libssl-dev or openssl-devel and libbz2-dev are installed. 
3. NovoalignCSMPI also requires hdf5 and hdf5-cpp version 1.8.8 or later
4. Run command
     make all
or   make novoalignMPI   if you don't need CS
     
This should create novoalignMPI & novoalignCSMPI binaries in this folder. You can 
then test from here or copy elsewhere. Remember a novoalign.lic file is required 
to run these programs so make sure it's in PATH or in folder with novoalignMPI.

If you are having trouble with link stage of the build such as missing symbols 
please ensure libcrypto.so and libbz2.so are available. If still having trouble 
try the Linux2.6 version of Novocraft programs.
